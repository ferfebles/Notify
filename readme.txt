Simple notification for Windows. You can launch a popup that can act when you click, close or wait until timeout.

Simple test:

  notify "Title" "Some text inside"

With timeout and click command

  notify "Title" "Some text inside" "20" "cmd /c %windir%\notepad.exe"

See the examples for more use cases, or launch notify for help.
